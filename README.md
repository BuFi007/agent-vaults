# SuperVault - AI-Powered DeFi Yield Optimizer

## Overview
SuperVault is an autonomous DeFi yield optimization system built on Avalanche, using LangChain AI agents to intelligently manage USDC positions across various DeFi protocols, starting with Aave.

## Key Features
- **AI-Driven Yield Optimization**: Automated monitoring and rebalancing of positions
- **Safe Transaction Management**: Uses Gnosis Safe for secure transaction execution
- **Real-time APR Monitoring**: Tracks and compares yields across protocols
- **Automated Rebalancing**: Moves funds between vault and protocols based on yield opportunities
- **USDC-Focused**: Currently optimized for USDC yield management

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **YieldOptimizer Agent**
   - Built with LangChain and GPT-4
   - Autonomous decision-making for yield optimization
   - Periodic monitoring and rebalancing
   - Real-time APR analysis

2. **Safe Integration**
   - Secure transaction execution through Gnosis Safe
   - Multi-signature support
   - Transaction batching capabilities

3. **Protocol Integrations**
   - Aave V3 on Avalanche
   - APR monitoring and comparison
   - Deposit and withdrawal automation

## Setup

1. Environment Variables

bash
AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
SAFE_ADDRESS=your_safe_address
AVALANCHE_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url

2. Install Dependencies

bash
npm start


## How It Works

1. **Monitoring**
   - Checks vault balances every hour
   - Fetches current APR rates from Aave
   - Analyzes yield opportunities

2. **Optimization**
   - Compares APR rates across protocols
   - Identifies opportunities with >0.5% yield difference
   - Executes deposits/withdrawals through Safe

3. **Security**
   - All transactions executed through Gnosis Safe
   - Multi-step verification process
   - Fail-safe mechanisms for transaction errors

## Current Capabilities
- Monitor USDC, USDT, and WAVAX positions
- Fetch real-time APR data from Aave
- Execute deposits and withdrawals through Safe
- Automated hourly yield checks
- Detailed transaction logging

## Development Status
- âœ… Safe integration
- âœ… Aave V3 integration
- âœ… APR monitoring
- âœ… Automated deposits/withdrawals
- ðŸ”„ Additional protocol integrations (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ Advanced yield strategies (in progress)
